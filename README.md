# javascript thing my friends have to make

My friends didn't get Javascript class; only a last minute self study thing and no help from the teachers, and a harsh deadline.
I didn't want to just make it for them and say "upload", or teach them one specific way (whether how correct or incorrect I deem it).

So instead I opted to make every exercise; but writing down why I did what, multiple options on how to achieve it, and pros and cons of every solution.
So they couldn't just upload it straight like this without editing the code, and hopefully learn something in the process!

While the assignments aren't mine; the code written fully is, and hasn't been taken from the class courses. So **excluding the comments with the assignments**, this is under the [Unlicense](LICENSE)
